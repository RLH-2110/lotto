This is a small project for testing out Python.

I was told to add the bias thing and to do the other lotto variant aswell, I decided to just copy the one I have and adjust it, instead of fiddleing with the existing code to work with both.

I am not quite comfortable with python, and I a not the best with grapical UI.
